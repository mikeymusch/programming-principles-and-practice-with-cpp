On programming and problem solving - page 12
  "We consider programming itself a form of problem solving: only through complete understanding of a problem and its solution can your express
   a correct program for it, and only through constructing and testing a program can you be certain that your understanding is complete"

  To me this perfectly encapsulates the process of programming a solution to a problem. 
  A computer program is the expression of steps necessary to solve a problem.
  Without being able to identify every necessary step, you can't write a complete solution.
